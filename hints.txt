New Goal;Search Jonna's and Alvin's house;3;2.1;S;;
;I'm pretty sure I'll find something in the house that will further my investigation. I can reach the upper floor from the hallway.;;;;;wm11a
;I've located Alvin's room. I see something worth examining in front of the TV.;;;;;wm11b_lift2

New Goal;Check out Green Tile Skatepark;4;3.2;S;;
;This is one big jumble of concrete. But there might be something interesting at the very end of the area.;;;;;fin11d_lift

New Goal;Collect general information about Alvin;5;4.1;S;;
;I think I have the code to the drawer in Alvin's room now. It must be 'ALRQ'.;;;;;wm11a_op
;There's a plastic card of some kind in Alvin's drawer.;;;;;wm11a_card2
;A passcard to a train museum is not something you find among every teenager's belongings. They must know something about Alvin there. ;;;;;ho1_05b
;It's a long shot, but I'll see if there's something left of the Old Railway Museum.;;;;;train09c
;If I examine the Old Railway Museum and the Train Museum closely, I might be able to find clues for accessing the tablet in Alvin's drawer. I think the solution is 29 (square), 36 (open numbers), 7 (circle), and 62 (triangle).;;;;;wm11a_tab3

New Goal;Examine the skatespot in Twin Oaks;8;6.5,6.6,7.2;S;;
;There's a torn piece of plywood I should check out at the beginning of the skateboarding area. ;;;;;sme15c_lift2
;If I continue down the pavement and then turn to the right by a small transformer station (small electrical power station), I'll eventually reach a second transformer station. There must be some meaning to it, since it was mentioned on the piece of plywood.;;;;;sme14d

;I think I missed something at the Adventure Golf. It's close to the tram.;;;;;golf14d_cl
;I can unlock the smartphone in the metal cabinet behind the transformer station in Twin Oaks using the colours on the podium on the Adventure Golf. Number 2 is blue, number 1 is green, and number 3 is red.;;;;;sme14d_op4

New Goal;Pick up some garbage;16;7.2,8.2,9.1,10.1,11.1,12.1,13.3,14.2,15.1;S;;
;I can see several trashy objects in the beginning of the park. One is left of the playground slide, one to the left of the sandbox, and one close to the small creek. Before I cross the bridge, I must go to the right to find something. Immediately after having passed the bridge, there's a small object to the right. Further up, there is a yogurt bottle to the right, and at the end of the area, a soft drink can.;;;;;several
