# Carol Refurbished

## Introduction

This is a sample game made by [MDNA games](https://mdna-games.com) using the [EgoVenture First Person Adventure framework for Godot.](https://github.com/deep-entertainment/egoventure).

It showcases all features available in EgoVenture and its accompanying plugins [Parrot](https://github.com/deep-entertainment/parrot) and [Speedy Gonzales](https://github.com/deep-entertainment/speedy_gonzales) and is based on the [EgoVenture game template](https://github.com/deep-entertainment/egoventure-game-template).

## Automatic distribution

The game is automatically exported to Windows, macOS and Linux upon every push and made available on [its itch.io page](https://deepgames.itch.io/carol-refurbished).

## Development

This repository is used as a showcase for EgoVenture and also as a reference implementation of EgoVenture and its plugins.

So there's no active development here per se, but rather tests and optimizations.

Still, if you like to implement a new feature or fix a bug in the addons, feel free to fork and use the repository for that.

We're happy to check out any pull request you might send. Thanks for your support!
